# 🦕 A REST-API built with Deno

I built this tiny REST-like API while playing around with Deno. Notice how it's completely written in TypeScript and needs no 100GB sized node_modules folder! ✨

## Endpoints

- /employees --> Returns an array of employees
- /employee/:id --> Returns a single employee

## Setup

1. `git clone`
2. `deno run --allow-net app.ts`
