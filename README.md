# 🦕 A REST-API built with Deno

I built this tiny REST-like API while playing around with Deno. Notice how it's completely written in TypeScript and needs no 100GB sized node_modules folder! ✨

## Endpoints

- GET /employees --> Get all employees
- GET /employee/:id --> Get a single employee
- POST /employees --> Create a new employee

## Setup

1. `git clone`
2. `deno run --allow-net app.ts`
